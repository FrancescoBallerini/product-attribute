To use this module, you need to:

Go to Settings > Sales > Pricelist > enable pricelist and select advanced price rules (discounts, formulas).

In the product form-view, click the 'Sales tab' in 'Fixed Price' section (which is not fixed price anymore..todo rename it)
and add rule based on formula. You can choose sale price, cost or other pricelist.

You can see the selling price recomputing automatically. You will also find a user input and a button "Set Price Discount".

Provide an input and click button to setup the price % discount based on percentage change between computed
selling price (based on supplierinfo price) and your input value.

Additional notes:

Note that this feature is mostly supposed to be used by product-view form. Despite this, the feature is also available from standard Pricelist menu, but for technical reason
the new section "Compute Selling Price" will be shown only after record save (in case of newly created pricelist) and it will only be visible if the rule applies on product template or product variant.
